# Python
This fold contain python files of some of the tasks I did in hyperionDev.


## Cafe
This code represents a menu system for the Africa Continental Cafe. It starts by welcoming the user and asking for their order. The available menu items, stock quantities, and prices are stored in lists and dictionaries. The code then displays the menu items along with their stock quantities and prices. It calculates the total worth of the menu items in stock by multiplying the stock quantity with the price for each item. The calculated total stock value is printed. Finally, a thank you message is displayed. The code demonstrates basic Python programming concepts such as lists, dictionaries, loops, and calculations.
