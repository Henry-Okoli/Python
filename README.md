# Python
This fold contain python files of some of the tasks I did in hyperionDev.


## Cafe
This code represents a menu system for the Africa Continental Cafe. It starts by welcoming the user and asking for their order. The available menu items, stock quantities, and prices are stored in lists and dictionaries. The code then displays the menu items along with their stock quantities and prices. It calculates the total worth of the menu items in stock by multiplying the stock quantity with the price for each item. The calculated total stock value is printed. Finally, a thank you message is displayed. The code demonstrates basic Python programming concepts such as lists, dictionaries, loops, and calculations.


## Strings
This code provides a simple financial calculator that can calculate investment interest or bond repayments. The program starts by presenting the user with two options: "investment" or "bond." The user can choose either option by entering the corresponding keyword. If the user selects "investment," they need to provide the deposit amount, interest rate, investment duration in years, and choose between simple or compound interest. The program calculates the total amount after the specified investment period using the provided information. If the user chooses "bond," they need to input the present value of the house, interest rate, and the number of months to repay the bond. The program calculates the monthly bond repayment amount based on the provided values. The user is then presented with the result: the total amount for investment or the monthly bond repayment. The code utilizes while loops to ensure valid user input and handles potential errors. It employs mathematical formulas and functions from the math module to perform calculations. Follow the instructions prompted by the program and input the required values accurately to obtain correct results
